# Lotto Number Generator
An old project which generates random numbers for lottery.

This uses the terminal, there is no GUI.

General.java asks for specific information to act as conditions when generating number. e.g. maximum numbers, amount of numbers picked, etc.

Each java file is set for each game conditions.
